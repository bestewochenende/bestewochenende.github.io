    "text": "Thursday - Espit Chupitos\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first day of the bachelors weekend will involve, for most of us, roadtripping with (hopefully) singalong karaoke in the car. Then we will kick off the weekend with an ‚ÄúEspit Chupitos‚Äù themed BBQ, blending Spanish party vibes with reggaeton beats. Please arrive to the property in your theme inspired outfit so we can set the mood for the weekend to come.\n\n\n\n\n\n29.05.2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFriday - Dancing Queens\n\n\n\n\n\nFriday will be all about channeling our inner Dancing Queens with a full day of ABBA and 70s disco vibes. Everyone will be dressed in their finest retro outfits ready to keep the energy high from morning till night. During the day, we‚Äôll explore the big property with plenty of games, challenges, and a few surprises along the way, all while enjoying some great food and the French sun.\n\n\n\n\n\n30.05.2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday - Le petit coq\n\n\n\n\n\nThere won‚Äôt be much time to recover, as Saturday will roll straight into the ‚ÄúLe Petit Coq‚Äù theme, celebrating France not for its people but for its countryside and food. The day will be packed with more games and challenges across the property, keeping the energy high. In the evening, we‚Äôll switch gears for a very fancy dinner, with everyone expected to dress as sharp. Take inspiration from the dresscode of the wedding but then a short version. We will be eating the famous french dish, pizza, as naturally this could not be missed in this weekend celebrating Y&A.\n\n\n\n\n\n31.05.2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday - Recovery\n\n\n\n\n\nWith hopefully leftover pizza in our belly and lots of electrolytes, Sunday we will make our way back to real life.\n\n\n\n\n\n01.06.2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeine Treffer"
